Project Setup: SSO & Server GuideThis document summarizes the key steps and configurations required to run this full-stack application with Windows Single Sign-On (SSO) in both production and development environments.1. Production WorkflowFor production, the Node.js server is responsible for serving both the backend API and the static React frontend files.Backend Routing: Ensure server.js has the correct routing order to prevent conflicts.API endpoints with SSO middleware (e.g., /api).express.static middleware to serve the static client assets from the /client/dist directory.A final catch-all route (app.get('*', ...)) to serve index.html for all client-side routes.Client-side Configuration: In the client's .env.production file, the VITE_API_BASE_URL must be an empty string (VITE_API_BASE_URL=). This ensures the frontend makes all API calls using relative paths, which are handled by the same server.2. Development WorkflowFor development, the client and server are run separately to enable a faster workflow with hot reloading.Client Server: Run the React frontend with the Vite development server (npm run dev).Backend Server: Run the Node.js backend server (node server.js) on a different port (e.g., 5200).Client-side Configuration: The client's .env.development file must specify the full URL of the backend server (VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5200).CORS: To avoid CORS errors in development, the backend's cors middleware should explicitly allow the client's development origin (http://localhost:5173) to make authenticated requests.Key Fixes & DebuggingPathError: This error was resolved by using a single, correctly ordered catch-all route (app.get('*', ...)).500 Internal Server Error: This was fixed by ensuring the express.static middleware was used to serve the static files, preventing the catch-all route from intercepting asset requests.CORS Errors: The final solution involved configuring the backend's CORS middleware to explicitly allow the development origin (http://localhost:5173) when the request includes credentials, satisfying the browser's security requirements.
